# Spark Performance Tuning

This repository is a guide for mastering advanced Spark Performance Tuning and Optimization concepts for Data Engineering involving Spark. The goal of the code snippets is to make complex concepts in Apache Spark easy to understand, while also developing a deep understanding of how things work under the hood.
